### Patch Changes

- [#35](https://github.com/stealth-scale/config/pull/35) [`b271aae`](https://github.com/stealth-scale/config/commit/b271aaec473fab167732606b8ffa52672259fcbf) Thanks [@stealth-rklopper](https://github.com/stealth-rklopper)! - components: hold every package to the barrel rule its ADR already states
  
  - ADR-0018 puts a specification beside every source file, the barrels included, and records that the
    conformance suite holds a package to it "where the package asks with `barrels: true`, which every
    component package does". Ten of the sixteen asked for nothing, so the rule was written down and
    enforced nowhere in them.
  - `collections`, `content`, `data`, `disclosure`, `feedback`, `forms`, `modals`, `navigation`,
    `screen` and `surfaces` now ask. The check reported thirteen barrels with no specification beside
    them, each now written: the package barrel of nine of those ten, `screen`'s folding and focus
    barrels, and `collections`' collection barrel.
  - A barrel specification names every export as a sorted list and asserts that neither a recipe nor a
    binding is among them, which is what catches a leaked binding and a dropped export.
  - Forty-three barrels under `foundations/` and `packages/` still have no specification. The ADR's
    decision covers them and its enforcement note does not, so they are left for a pass of their own.
